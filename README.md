# Boop
GlobalGameJam 2020


You are Karen. Your life is hard. Boop is the only lifestyle brand that really knows who you are, what you are, and how difficult it is being bored and upper middle class. Today is the day of your interview at Boop HQ. Your goal, avoid all the negative energy coming your way, keep your aura full, and make it to your interview on time. Replenish your aura with wheatgrass shots and coffee. Find facial masks along the way to achieve impenetrable bliss. Keep an eye on the timer and make sure to arrive in style.
